# The Ultimate List of Developer Resources 

### Introduction
Hello there! This list is a personal project I have been working on as a tool to aid me in my journey to become a software developer. It is currently in its early stages and only includes front-end resources for the most part, because that is as far as I've gotten! However, over the time that I spend learning, I will be adding every good resource I find that I've found helpful to this list in a somewhat organized fashion. 


### How to Contribute
Please read [Contributing](#). 
I invite others who are on this journey to contribute to this project as well and feel free to share any resources that they believe will help others learn or will make life easier for fellow developers.
